# Reference finder
Desktop application to manage personal collections of any kind of pictures(manga, memes, book paragraphs...). The goal is to make references easy to store and to search for.

# How it works
- Extract text from images using machine learning techniques and store them as tags.
- Search images using the tags.

Personalized tags: There should always be a possibility for the user to edit/add tags. //will be helpful in the case where pictures don't have any text within. 
- Personalized tags should be stored in the same way chaining works in hash collisions; Linked list on each principal tag.
